                        "GBP is the base currency. EUR and USD prices are calculated from the GBP price using a fixed reference rate we maintain, with no conversion fee or surcharge added by us. Your bank or card issuer may apply its own exchange rate and fees. See the Payment and Account Balance Policy for details.",

                    answer:
                        "Digital content is covered by specific rules. Because you ask us to begin delivery immediately, your statutory right of withdrawal ends once delivery begins — you confirm this with a checkbox before paying. Refunds for non-delivery, duplicate charges, material defects and other cases are set out in the Refund and Cancellation Policy.",

                    answer:
                        "Usually yes. A template may require separately purchased hosting, a domain name, and software such as WordPress, Shopify or specific plugins. These are not included unless the Product description says so, so please check the requirements before buying.",
